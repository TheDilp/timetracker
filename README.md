## My process

It was a fairly simple and straightforward process - used CRA to bootstrap a react application, created the profile card component, focusing on the mobile design first, then moving onto the individual habits a user would track by making a habit card component. Once I was done with the mobile design (375px) I moved onto the desktop design (1440px) and spent time getting that layout right.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

For continued development I would add more functionality, such ass adding and removing things for tracking time, auth (register, login, etc.). For monetization it might be prudent to limit the number of items a free user can have vs a subscribed one.

I would also add more breakpoints besides the one the project requires (375px and 1440px) for better responsiveness.
